# PoweredUpJS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clebert/powered-up.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clebert/powered-up)
[![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@powered-up/api.svg)](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/@powered-up/api)

> A Node.js SDK for programming the LEGO® Powered Up platform.

## Getting started

Please install the `@powered-up/api` package as described
[here](https://clebert.github.io/powered-up/packages/api/).

The following example uses a Smart Move Hub (included in the LEGO® Boost
Set 17101) and activates the built-in motor A while the button is held down:

```js
// @ts-check

const {SmartMoveRobot} = require('@powered-up/api');
const {autorun} = require('mobx');

const moveRobot = new SmartMoveRobot();

autorun(() => {
  const {buttonPressed, encodedMotorA, rgbLight} = moveRobot;

  if (!encodedMotorA || !rgbLight) {
    return;
  }

  if (buttonPressed) {
    rgbLight.setColor({red: 0, green: 255, blue: 0});

    encodedMotorA.runWithPower(100);
  } else {
    rgbLight.setColor({red: 255, green: 0, blue: 0});

    encodedMotorA.brake();
  }
});
```

[demo package](https://github.com/clebert/powered-up/tree/master/@powered-up/demo/src).**
